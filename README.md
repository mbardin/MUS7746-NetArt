# The Circle of Life

This is the repo containing all of the code necessary for my browser-based project: _The Circle of Life_.

Program Note:

User controls:

Use the "Choose User Mode" Button to choose between any of the three user modes:

Place: place text and shapes on the screen. Type text into the text box and hit enter to send. Click a shape to pick one up, click again to put it down.
Edit: Adjust the colors of the shapes. Use the shiders to change the amount of red, green, and blue in the shape's color, then click on the shape you want to change.
View: Observe what other are creating
