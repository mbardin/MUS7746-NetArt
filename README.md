# The Circle of Life v. 0.2.3

This is the repo containing all of the code necessary for my browser-based project: _The Circle of Life_.

## Program Note:

Whether intentional or not, humans have a profound effect on their environment. This work take this effect to the extreme. By encouraging users to place various items in the webpage and alter their appearance the users are able to create a unique visual arrangement of basic polygon art. However, be careful how much you edit as each interaction has unexpected consequences that can change what the background music is doing. If you are too careless, you may turn the environment into something inhospitable that could take a long time before everything is comfortable again.

That is just with one user. Imagine how chaotic the environment can grow with multiple?

## User controls:

Use the "Choose User Mode" Button to choose between any of the three user modes:

Place: place text and shapes on the screen. Type text into the text box and hit enter to send. Click a shape to pick one up, click again to put it down.
Edit: Adjust the colors of the shapes. Use the sliders to change the amount of red, green, and blue in the shape's color, then click on the shape you want to change.
View: Observe what others are creating.


**Note:** In this version triangles and angled lines can be placed, but their color can not be edited. Peer-to-peer networking is still being tweaked, for now, each instance will run locally within the browser without communicating with other devices.
